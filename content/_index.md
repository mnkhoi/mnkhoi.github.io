# ᕦʕ •ᴥ•ʔᕤ Khoi's Den

Welcome to my site,

I don't know why you are here but...

I'm going to make it simple. I am Khoi, a 4th year _computer science_ and
_mathematics_ student at [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).

I previously interned at [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en.html) as a RTG SOC DV infrastructure engineer.
Basically, I make tools for the team. :DDDD

I am really interesting in fantasy football and basketball, some investing
here and there. And doom scrolling through LinkedIn.

In terms of technologies, I am really really interested in **compiler** and
**computer languages** work and **distributed system** ... and **operating system** and
... making things and ... idk. Too much....

But I like to deliver useful products for stakeholders the most :D

If you want to learn more about me.

PS. I like clean websites - straight to the point -
