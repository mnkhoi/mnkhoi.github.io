      <p>Hi!!!</p>
      <p>Welcome to my site, I don't know why you are here but....</p>
      <p>
        I am going to make it simple. I am Khoi, a 4th year Computer Science and
        Mathematics student at <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/"
          >University of Toronto<a></a>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I previously interned at <a href="https://www.amd.com">AMD</a> as a RTG SOC
        DEV infrastructure engineer. Basically, I make tools for the team.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am really interested in fantasy football and basketball, some
        investing here and there. And doom scrolling through LinkedIn.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of technologies, I am <i>really <strong>really</strong> </i>
        in compiler and computer languages work and distributed system... and operating
        system and ... making things and ... idk. Too much ....
      </p>
      <p>But I like to deliver useful products for stakeholders the most :D</p>
      <p>If you want to learn more about me.</p>
      <p>PS. I like clean websites - straight to the point -</p>
